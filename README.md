# hapi-react-redux-example
This is an example app using [hapi-react-redux](https://github.com/kellyrmilligan/hapi-react-redux)

hapi-react-redux was built to be a module on it's own so that you can integrate it as you please. this is just one way to do it.

### running the app
you will need to get something for github to be accessible to the app?

### TODO
- trying to get hot css reloading working with extract text plugin, see this issue:
https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues/30#issuecomment-263279212
for now it just refreshes the page all the time. a fallback is to add style loader in dev only.
- exclude moment locales
- remove redux form and validator when building sample app
- skim through survivejs, create-react-app, tcwebpack for stuff? look at just adding this to create-react-app?
- group scss with components?
- add jest configuration and some tests
- add flow?
