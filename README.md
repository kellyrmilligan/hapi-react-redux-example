# hapi-react-redux-example
This is an example app using [hapi-react-redux](https://github.com/kellyrmilligan/hapi-react-redux)

hapi-react-redux was built to be a module on it's own so that you can integrate it as you please. this is just one way to do it.

### running the app
you will need to generate a personal access token in github. Then in your terminal export this variable as `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, either when you run the app, like `GITHUB_API_TOKEN=[insert token here] yarn start` or export it in your bash profile.

### TODO
- tackle scss. full page reload is ok.
- webpack server side?
- fetch api instead of superagent
- babel-polyfill in webpack
